# Intuitive Programming

## What is Intuitive Programming ?

Intuitive Programming is a set of rules I have written to improve productivity and code readability while programming.

It was originally written for myself but could possibly help many people to write better code.

## Rule 1 - Write your code as you would oraly explain what it does

### Rule 1.1 - The subject is the object

### Rule 1.2 - The verb is the function

### Rule 1.3 - The complements are your arguments

## Rule 2 - Write your fonction calls before the function themselves

## Rule 3 - Start from the more complex and abtract part of the code to the simpliest parts in possibly many iterations

## Rule 4 - Prefer data over code

### Rule 4.1 - Never use switch case, use associative array or dictionaries

## Rule 5 - No more than 2 arguments, after that, use named options

## Rule 6 - Keep it short
